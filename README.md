# Artsome

This frontend project is a continuation on the backend assignment Express API. IT is about creating a API using Exress.js for the first time. I chose to also build this website that fetches the data and displays the artists.

## The problem
The API is extremely slow and I am facing certain limitations since this backend project was simple and not very complex - since it was a beginners project to learn the basics.
